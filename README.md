Hey, I'm Saph!

I'm just someone here who likes to learn and is currently learning both Python and JavaScript.
I probably won't post many good or even decent repositories as honestly, I'm really new to both these languages.

Not much to add... I go by she/her, in my early 20's and just like learning tech stuff.
